  <h2>My Abah</h2>
  <p>
    This is my dad, Azlan bin Abd Ghafar, a proud Negeri Sembilan native. He’s a very funny person most of the time, 
    especially when he’s in a good mood. However, he can also be strict and quick-tempered, especially when his children do something he disapproves of.
    Despite his stern nature, my dad has a soft side, especially for the people he loves, particularly his family.
    He always makes sure that all his children’s needs are met and works tirelessly to provide for his family of seven children. 
    In his free time, he enjoys fishing and riding motorcycles with his friends.
    I have to admit that I’m one of the children who is closest to him. We often talk about shared interests, 
    which has strengthened our bond. My dad has taught me the value of perseverance, especially in the face of hardships, 
    because he believes that every challenge comes with hidden blessings and greater rewards.
    My dad is my everything, and I love him so much.

  <h2>My Mama</h2>
  <p>
    This is my mom. She is incredibly patient, understanding, and absolutely beautiful. 
    Despite her busy schedule, she always makes time to fulfill her children’s needs, often prioritizing us over herself. 
    She never hesitates to meet our requests, even if it means sacrificing her own share.
    I love her cooking, everything she makes, whether it’s dishes, pastries, or traditional snacks, always turns out delicious.
    My mom is also a teacher and expresses her love for us through actions rather than words. She enjoys watching K-dramas and 
    can be quite emotional. 
    She is calm and positive, always handling problems with grace and a level head. 
    I love her so much, and I can’t imagine life without her someday.

  <h2>Kakak Chacha</h2>
  <p>
    This is my oldest sister, Afrina Ariesya. She’s two years older than me and is currently pursuing a degree in Public Relations at UiTM Shah Alam. 
    I would describe her as incredibly independent, she has been doing everything on her own since a young age.
    I look up to her in so many ways because she’s truly inspiring. She’s a strong person who always prioritizes others over herself, whether it’s family, friends, or her partner.
    Whenever I face problems, she’s the one who gives me meaningful advice and practical solutions.
    She can be very strict and rarely shows her emotions or cries because she feels that, as the eldest, she needs to appear strong for everyone. 
    But sometimes she forgets that her feelings are valid too. She loves taking pictures and dressing up, and one of her dreams is to become an influencer someday hahaha!
    She’s not just my sister but also my closest friend and biggest supporter.

  <h2>Wawan</h2>
  <p>
    This is my one and only brother in the family, Afdlin Afwan. He just started university this year after completing his SPM and is currently studying Economics at UIA Gambang.
    He’s incredibly talented and has tried many things, especially in sports. He plays hockey, football, and badminton. 
    Back in primary school, he was a head prefect, and many teachers relied on him. He’s also a great singer and was involved in nasyid performances. 
    Since primary school, he’s had a lot of admirers, probably because people think he’s handsome, haha!
    He’s very friendly, especially with older people, and can easily blend in. As the only son in the family, he’s naturally protective of his sisters. 
    We often share similar topics and interests, which makes our bond even stronger.
    Even though he can be annoying most of the time, I know deep down he’s a good brother who listens and understands his responsibilities.

  <h2>Kiki</h2>
  <p>
    This is my fourth sibling, Afrina Aqeela, but the whole family calls her Kiki. She’s currently in Form 2. She’s someone who often likes to be on her own and hang out with friends, 
    probably at that age where she’s just starting to explore the world. We’ve all been there, right?
    She’s a bit boyish and quite stubborn, always trying to act tough. But when she reaches her limit, she shows her vulnerable side. She’s affectionate, but only with certain people. 
    She loves dressing up and spending her time doing activities typical for teenagers. She doesn’t like socializing with many people, but she and I are pretty close. 
    The chemistry between the second and fourth child hits differently, so I can usually match her vibe, haha.
    I love teasing her until she gets annoyed, and she does the same to me. She’s also an athlete who enjoys sports like running and other athletics. 
    I often invite her to go out with me because she rarely joins family outings. Even though she’s mischievous at times, I love her, and she always listens to instructions.

  <h2>Fieqah, Icha & Yaya</h2>
  <p>
    These are my three younger siblings. Fieqah is the fifth child in the family and is 11 years old. She is a quiet person but has many hidden talents and her own unique style.
    She enjoys activities like rugby tap and handball.
    Next is Icha, the sixth sibling, who is 9 years old. Icha is someone who loves dressing up and is very creative in arts and video content. She enjoys making random vlogs with her friends.
    She’s sentimental at times, although she can be a bit stubborn.
    Lastly, there’s Yaya, who is now 7 years old. Yaya is headstrong and has a bossy personality, but she is also very affectionate with Mama and her eldest sister.
    She’s talkative and brave when it comes to trying new things.
    I love them so much. Without them, the house feels so quiet.
