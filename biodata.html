                I am Afrina Adleena binti Azlan, a passionate and ambitious 20 years old 
                <i>(Born on 22 April 2004)</i>. I'm currently journeying through the Faculty of Information Management 
                at UiTM Rembau. Born in Selangor and now living in bustling Kuala Lumpur, I‚Äôm navigating my passion for 
                tech, data, and archives‚Äîwhile keeping life interesting! 
                <br><br>
                When I‚Äôm not hitting the books or exploring the digital world, I‚Äôm often hanging out with friends, 
                because there‚Äôs nothing better than good company! I‚Äôm also a proud cat parent to two adorable furballs, 
                Bobby and Lion, who keep my home lively and cozy.
                <br><br>
                On weekends or semester breaks, you‚Äôll probably find me taking up a part-time job to stay busy and 
                learn something new. Between cafe hunts, badminton games, and occasional nature escapes, I‚Äôm always ready 
                to dive into new experiences and keep growing.
                <br><br>
                Overall, I hope that with the energy and knowledge I have gained throughout my life, it can benefit everyone. 
                I also hope to achieve my goals and dreams. As I continue my journey, there is no doubt I will have a meaningful 
                impact on the lives of others.

                During my high school years at SMK Taman Melati, I was part of the Accounts and Economics stream in Form 4 
                and Form 5. Adapting to these subjects was tough, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when classes 
                shifted online. However, in Form 5, I found my motivation again and discovered a real passion for Economics. 
                <br><br>
                Alhamdulillah, after lots of effort and determination, I managed to achieve 6As in my SPM. This journey 
                inspired me to further my studies at UiTM Rembau. Now, as I enter my final semester, it feels bittersweet 
                knowing my diploma journey is coming to an end.

                This group of friends is my go-to when I‚Äôm at my lowest or need emotional support. We‚Äôve known each other 
                since high school. Two of them, Billa and Luqman, are studying at UiTM Rembau too. Nik Amall Nafeesa is my 
                longest friend; I‚Äôve known her since I was five.
                <br>
                We‚Äôve always dreamed of traveling together someday, and I can‚Äôt wait to make those memories.</br></div>

    <p>
      My family is full of cat lovers‚Äîeveryone in my house is crazy about cats, especially me. Whenever I‚Äôm out and see cats, 
      I always stop to pet them. At home, I have two cats who mean the world to me. 
      The first is <b>Bobby</b>, my everything. My dad found him alone at a traffic light, with no sign of his mother, 
      and decided to bring him home. We‚Äôve been taking care of Bobby ever since, and now he‚Äôs already 4 years old. Over the years, 
      we‚Äôve shared so many unforgettable moments with him. One of the hardest was when Bobby went missing for a whole month during 
      Hari Raya at our hometown. I was heartbroken, but by the grace of God, we eventually found him. Bobby loves exploring and 
      doing his own thing, but when I‚Äôm feeling down, he‚Äôs always there for me to hug.

    <p>
      The second is <b>Lion</b>, who showed up as a stray at the end of 2023. Despite our efforts to find his owner, no one came forward, 
      so we decided to take him in. Lion is incredibly affectionate and playful, but he often gets into little fights with Bobby. 
      Lion has a beautiful, fluffy coat with a combination of three colors‚Äîchocolate, black, and cream. People often say that cats with 
      three colors are very lucky. Whenever a family member is lying down in front of the TV, Lion will always curl up beside them, 
      which is absolutely adorable. He also meows loudly if he doesn‚Äôt get the attention he wants, making sure everyone notices him!
      Both Bobby and Lion are my happy pills, and they never fail to brighten my days.
