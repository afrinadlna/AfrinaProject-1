        I’m also a proud cat parent to two adorable furballs, Bobby and Lion, who keep my home lively and cozy.  On weekends or semester breaks, you’ll probably find me taking up a part-time job to stay busy and learn something new.Between cafe hunts, badminton games, and occasional nature escapes, I’m always ready to dive into new experiences and keep growing.And if it means lending a hand or picking up a new skill, count me in!
        .In my free time, I enjoy my hobbies which include listening to my favourite music genre and watching movies. Not to forget, When I have free time, when I have some extra money, you’ll likely find me at a concert of my favorite artist, making the most of my 20s and creating unforgettable memories with my friends.
        Overall, I hope that with the energy and knowledge I have gained throughout my life, it can benefit everyone. Not only that, I also hope that I can achieve my goals and dreams. As I continue my journey, there is no doubt that I will have a meaningful impact on the lives of others, inspiring them through her teaching and artistic endeavors.

        📌During my high school years at SMK Taman Melati, I was part of the Accounts and Economics stream in Form 4 and Form 5. Adapting to these subjects was tough, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when classes shifted online through Google Meet and other platforms. It was a challenging time, balancing new subjects with the lack of consistent face-to-face learning. However, in Form 5, I found my motivation again and discovered a real passion for Economics. However, in Form 5, I found my motivation again and discovered a real passion for Economics. Alhamdulillah, after putting in lots of effort and determination, I managed to achieve 6As in my SPM, a milestone I’m incredibly proud of. 
        This journey inspired me to further my studies at UiTM Rembau, where I’m now exploring the world of Information Management with enthusiasm and curiosity. Now, as I enter my final semester, it feels like time has flown by—it’s bittersweet knowing that my diploma journey is coming to an end. While I feel a bit sad, I’m glad to be completing this chapter and looking forward to what comes next..

        This group of friends is my go-to when I’m at my lowest or need emotional support. We’ve known each other since high school, and they hold a special place in my heart. Over the past two years, we’ve been through a lot, including arguments, but we always find our way back to each other no matter what happens. I’m so grateful to have them by my side because they always understands me. Two of them, Billa and Luqman, are studying at the same university as me, UiTM Rembau, where they’re both taking business courses. Even though we’re in the same place, we rarely meet up, but we’re always there for each other when needed. Nik Amall Nafeesa is my longest friend, I’ve known her since I was five. We’ve grown up together and watched each other become who we are today. I love her so much. 
        Mia and Hafiz are my ride-or-die friends, they always down for whatevr and that what makes me love them so much. During semester breaks, we always hang out and catch up. We love chatting and visiting aesthetic places together.
        We’re like puzzle pieces—each one of us brings something different to the group, and together, we just click. We’ve always dreamed of traveling together someday, and I can’t wait to make those memories.

        One thing I've learned to keep a friendship healthy, communicate openly and honestly about your thoughts and feelings, and always listen without judgment. Respect each other’s boundaries and personal space, and be supportive in both good times and bad. Make an effort to spend quality time together, even if it’s just a quick chat or a shared activity. 
        Show appreciation for one another through kind words and small gestures, and always be forgiving when conflicts arise. Lastly, celebrate your differences and cherish the moments that make your friendship special.

      My family is full of cat lovers—everyone in my house is crazy about cats, especially me. Whenever I’m out and see cats, I always stop to pet them. At home, I have two cats who mean the world to me. The first is Bobby, my everything.  My dad found him alone at a traffic light, with no sign of his mother, and decided to bring him home.  We’ve been taking care of Bobby ever since, and now he’s already 4 years old. Over the years, we’ve shared so many unforgettable moments with him. 
      One of the hardest was when Bobby went missing for a whole month during Hari Raya at our hometown.I was heartbroken, but by the grace of God, we eventually found him. Bobby loves exploring and doing his own thing, but when I’m feeling down, he’s always there for me to hug. 
      The second is Lion, who showed up as a stray at the end of 2023. Despite our efforts to find his owner, no one came forward, so we decided to take him in. Lion is incredibly affectionate and playful, but he often gets into little fights with Bobby. Lion has a beautiful, fluffy coat with a combination of three colors—chocolate, black, and cream. People often say that cats with three colors are very lucky.
      Whenever a family member is lying down in front of the TV, Lion will always curl up beside them, which is absolutely adorable. He also meows loudly if he doesn’t get the attention he wants, making sure everyone notices him!.Both Bobby and Lion are my happy pills, and they never fail to brighten my days.
